body:

I'm involved in the [Rust programming language][rust] team, as part of the
Infrastructure and Release teams. I'm also the maintainer and main developer of
[Crater][crater], a tool to test compiler changes across the Rust ecosystem.

I'm also part of the [italian Ubuntu community][ubuntu-it], where I manage the
website, the servers and the social media accounts.

In the past I also developed a few open source projects. While I don't actively
develop or maintain them anymore, I do a few tweaks to them when it's
necessary. You can find them on [my GitHub profile][github].
